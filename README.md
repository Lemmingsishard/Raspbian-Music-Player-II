WARNING: EARLY SIGNS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AHEAD

Raspian Music Player was an already great piece of software containing ... features and ... musical replay abilites. Now I the entire team of UPGSOFTWARE and WIZARD STUDIOS as a whole presents to you, RASPIAN MUSIC PLAYER II.
I've added the ability to play your own music, and not some pre-prepared music that I select, the ability to pause songs and change volume, and a state-of-the-art help system using Microsoft's one and only Compiled HTML Help system.
It hasn't all been good though, as we have lost a feature on the way. You no longer get fancy visual effects that may cause seizures. This is a true tragedy.
But the benefits outweigh the negetives and that is why you should invest in Raspbian Music Player today!
