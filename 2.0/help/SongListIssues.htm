<Title>Song list issues</Title>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<p>The only issue I could imagine anyone has with the song list is that it is too perfect :)</p>
<p>Ok, you probably have a real issue though. The only one I have come across is that sometimes when you click on a song, it doesn't switch to that song. The fix to this issue is just clicking said song more.</p>
<p>The reason this is an issue is, again, the autoplay system. For some reason the autoplay interferes with song switching.</p>
