    <li>Misc. Notes: while it is called <u>Raspbian</u> Music Player II, the help system is all windows based. For this reason I would recommend you use this on Windows and not Raspbian. Initailly, this program was meant as an alternative to VLC since VLC broke on my RPI. The OG version of this program sucked, so I decided to remake it. </li>
