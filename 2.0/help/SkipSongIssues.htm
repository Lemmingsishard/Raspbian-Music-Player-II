<p>If you are on this page, you are probably thinking: "REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE WHY IS THE SKIPING BUTTON SKIPING THE SONG I WANT TO HEAR AND MOVING TO THE SONG AFTER THAT REEEEEEEEEEEE"</p>
<p>To that I'd say: "Pause the song, then skip. Skiping while the song is playing can cause unexpected behavior due to the autoplay system."</p>
