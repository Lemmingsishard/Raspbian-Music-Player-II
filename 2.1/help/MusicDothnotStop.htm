<h1>Music Not Stopping Upon Closing</h1>
<p>If you're here you probably had a situation like this:<br>REEEEEEEEEEEEE why is this song still playing even through it should be closed. I HAAAAAATE having to open task manager every time I won't to close this damned program.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing this, you should make sure you either pause before closing, or use the Exit button in the File Menu instead of the X on the topright.</p>
