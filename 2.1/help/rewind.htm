<h2>You can't LOL</h2>
<p>Ok, you probably want a reason though. The truth is, I couldn't implement this. I know that you can calculate how long a song is with bitrate and file size. I also know that there are ways to jump around in songs with the pygame mixer, but I never found anything that would solve the base problem of not knowing how long a certain song could be. Don't expect this to become a future feature.</p>
